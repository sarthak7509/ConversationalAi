# Conversational Ai using Tensorflow
This is the implementation of multi head attention model on the cornell movie dataset. This is an implementation of Transformer models introduced in 2017 and is used in NLP in various task such as Translation (you can visit my other repository Neural Style Translation).

## How to use:-
1) first clone the repository
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/sarthak7509/ConversationalAi.git
```
2) Download the pretrained weights from [my drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tkWOcmNPeNeRaJY1MhTS9bcWB6gGKkcq/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the model weights section
3) Run conversationAi.py for demo or run app.py to start a local server that return the chatbot value for the POST methon
4) The training files are included under training folder use it to train custom model
